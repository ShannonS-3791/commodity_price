"iTIMBER","Timber Price Index (2010=100), based on nominal $US commodity prices","The Timber price index comprises two commodities: Logs (22.1 percent) and Sawnwood (77.9 percent).","The World Bank uses the Laspeyres price index formula in the calculation of its commodity price indices; in this formula, commodity weights from a base time period are used to measure price changes. Relative to other price index formulas, the Laspeyres formula has a tendency to overstate inflation because it does not account for changing demand in the face of price changes. In this case, weights of primary commodities included in the indices are derived based on developing countries' (that is, low- and middle-income countries as defined by the World Bank in June 2006) export values between 2002 and 2004. Underlying commodity prices are collected from a variety of international commodity study groups, government agencies, industry trade journals, and data feed systems. Sources for the trade data are United Nations' Comtrade Database via World Bank WITS system, Food and Agriculture Organization FAOSTAT Database, International Energy Agency Database, BP Statistical Review of World Energy, World Metal Statistics, World Bureau of Metal Statistics and World Bank staff estimates. The index is calculated to a base year of 2010 = 100.","WB"
